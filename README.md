#  A curated list of Open Source projects developed with a microservices architectural style

After several questions opened in Quora[4,5,6], StackOverflow [2,3], ResearchGate [1], I decided to report the list of projects that migrated to microservices or that are implemented from scratch with a microservice architectural style. 
In our previous work, we investigated several microservices issues, including migration issues[10], architectural patterns[9],  and bad smells or antipatterns[8]. The availability of a common data-set of projects implemented with a microservice architectural style, would be very useful to validate our results, but also to anyone who need to learn how to develop microservices-based applications or to researchers that want to study how these systems are architected. 


The list could be useful to anyone who need to learn how to develop microservices-based applications or to researchers tha  t want to study how these systems are architected. 
If you are interested to the Architecture related principles, tools and technologies, please consider this github page https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices

I am still  looking for a real legacy project (5-10 years old) where I can study how it evolved from Monolithic to microservices. I think this is a common issue of most of the researchers working on microservices, and if we will manage to find at least one, it could be a very good starting point.




Feel free to contribute suggesting other projects.
